# test-versioning
This is used as a test repo to utilize the semantic-versioning function. This would bring the following benefits:

- Standardization of commit messages
- Automatic detection of next version number for the appropriate branch, based on the commit message. As shown on https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release.
